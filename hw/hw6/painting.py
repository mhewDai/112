p = '''The numbers on the board represent how many bombs
are adjacent to a square. For example, if a square 
has a "3" on it, then there are 3 bombs next to that 
square. The bombs could be above, below, right left, 
or diagonal to the square. Avoid all the bombs and 
expose all the empty spaces to win Minesweeper.'''

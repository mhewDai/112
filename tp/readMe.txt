about: This is a python version of the classic game of Minesweeper that includes a hint generator, which guides the player to the final result. 

How to run program:
To run this program, you must first install all the necessary libraries. All the necessary pictures are already in the main folder and pictures do not need to be removed from any folders.

Make sure to import Board from board.py file and the hint from hintGenerator.py file as well as have cmu_112_graphics all in the same folder. 

Libraries Needed:
-PIL
-Pygame

Keyboard shortcuts:
Pressing 'f' initiates flag mode
Pressing 'r' is a hard reset that sends you back to main menu
Pressing 'h' sends you to help screen
Pressing the smile face in the middle resets the board, but keeps the difficulty
